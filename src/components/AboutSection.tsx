                I'm Cole Nielson, based in Boise, Idahoâ€”a real estate professional and Boise State University student graduating in December 2025.

              <p>
                My journey into coding and AI began in March 2025 with absolutely no prior experience. In less than a year, I've gone from complete beginner to building complex AI systems and web applications that solve real-world problems.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My mission is to help small businesses and professionals leverage AI tools through automation and custom AI integrations. I believe that the future belongs to those who can effectively harness AI's capabilities, and I'm dedicated to making these technologies accessible to everyone.
